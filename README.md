# Conway's Game of Life

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. <br/>
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. <br/>
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. <br/>
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. <br/>

How to play: <br/>
Play: Starts the animation and as each generations goes by, it follows the rules above. <br/>
Pause: Pauses the animation. <br/>
Clear: Clears the board and takes us back to generation 0.<br/>
Slow: Slows down the speed of the animation. <br/>
Fast: Speeds up the speed of the animation. <br>
Seed: Randomly places a alive or dead state in each cell. <br>
Grid Size: Choose the size of the grid you'd like. <br>

Clicking on a cell when pause will change the state to the opposite of what it already is. (ex. alive turns to dead, dead turns to alive). <br>

Dead: Grey cell <br>
Alive: Green cell
